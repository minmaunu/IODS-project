I have only completed so far reading and exercises from chapter 1 and 2 and I'm panicking a little. For me it was difficult to understand how the course starts and I was confused what to complete. Also, I didn't remember how much work 5 credits course can be :) I expect to learn how to use Github and understand R code. I heard about the course from university email. 

The crash course is excellent, easy to follow and understand, but I should have had more time to go it trough, because everything was new to me. So far I have only completed chapters 1 and 2.
